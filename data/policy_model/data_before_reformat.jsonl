We are tasked with showing that the number of disloyal elements is at most $(n-1) / 2$.\n\n2. **Understanding Disloyal Elements**:\n   \n   Recall that an integer is considered disloyal if it shares a factor with $n$. We know that an element of $(\\mathbb{Z} / n\\mathbb{Z})^{*}$ (the units modulo $n$) is disloyal if it has the same order modulo each prime factor of \\( n \\). \n\n3. **Application of Euler's Totient Function**:\n   \n   By definition, Euler's Totient Function, $\\varphi(n)$, counts the number of elements in $(\\mathbb{Z} / n\\mathbb{Z})^{*}$. Our goal is to show that there are at most $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ disloyal elements. We can equivalently show that there are at most $\\frac{\\varphi(n)}{2}$ elements that can be disloyal.\n\n4. **Chinese Remainder Theorem and Existence of Elements with Specific Order**:\n   \n   Let \\( p \\) be a prime factor of \\( n \\).

Here:\n   \\[\n   \\ell(p, x) \\neq \\ell(p, kx) \n   \\]\n   However, for any prime \\( q \\neq p \\),\n   \\[\n   \\ell(q, x) = \\ell(q, kx)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Behavior of the Valuation Function**:\n   \n   Note that if \\( x \\) is disloyal, the integers \\(\\ell(q, x)\\) do not depend on \\( q \\).

For instance:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AG}{GA'} = \\frac{CG}{GC'} = -\\frac{BG}{GB'}\n   \\]\n\nBy using the prior arguments, we acquire the conclusion that \\( B' \\) is still the midpoint of \\( AC \\). From the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AG}{GA'} = -\\frac{BG}{GB'}\n   \\]\n   we derive:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AG}{GA'} + \\frac{GA'}{GA'} - 1 = -\\frac{BG}{GB'} - \\frac{GB'}{GB'} + 1\n   \\]\n   simplifying to:\n   \\[\n   2r^2 - r + 1 = 0,\n   \\]\n   where \\( r = \\frac{GB'}{BB'} \\). This quadratic equation results in complex roots, thus excluding this case.\n\nThus, the only remaining scenario is the case analyzed above, confirming the medians.

According to the problem, each segment of the line must intersect with some other segment, and those intersections must be mutually perpendicular. This inherently implies a symmetric structure.\n   - Furthermore, if the closed polygonal line is symmetric, the number of segments (let's denote it as \\(N\\)) must be even. This is because symmetry around an axis would divide the line into two equal parts.\n   \n2. **Parity and Modulo Property**: \n   - Upon closer inspection of the criteria and the nature of such a symmetrical shape, we need \\(N\\) to also not be divisible by 4. The reasoning behind this stems from the intersection requirement.

We need to find all integral solutions $(a, b, c)$.\n\n#### Case 1: $a = 0$\nIf $a = 0$, the equation simplifies to $b^2 + c^2 = 0$. Since both $b^2$ and $c^2$ are non-negative, they must both be zero. Thus, $(a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0)$ is a solution.\n\n#### Case 2: $b = 0$\nBy symmetry of the equation in $a$ and $b$, if $b = 0$, then $a^2 + c^2 = 0$. This similarly leads to $a = 0$ and $c = 0$, giving the solution $(a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n#### Case 3: $c = 0$\nIf $c = 0$, then $a^2 + b^2 = a^2b^2$. If either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, we revert to the previous cases. Assume $a, b \\neq 0$. Then, $1 + \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2 = b^2$. Let $x = \\frac{b}{a}$, then $1 + x^2 = a^2x^2$. Rearranging gives $x^2(a^2 - 1) = 1$. Since $x$ is rational, $a^2 - 1$ must be a perfect square. However, this leads to a contradiction unless $a = 1$ or $a = -1$. If $a = 1$, then $b^2 = 2$, which has no integer solutions. If $a = -1$, then $b^2 = 2$, which also has no integer solutions.\n\n#### Case 4: $a, b, c \\neq 0$\nAssume $a, b, c$ are all non-zero. We analyze the equation modulo 4. Squares are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Thus, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\equiv 0, 1, 2, \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$, and $a^2b^2 \\equiv 0 \\text{ or } 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n- If $a^2 \\equiv b^2 \\equiv c^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, then $a, b, c$ are all even. Let $a = 2a_1$, $b = 2b_1$, $c = 2c_1$. Substituting back, we get $4(a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2) = 16a_1^2b_1^2$. Simplifying, $a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2 = 4a_1^2b_1^2$. Repeating this process leads to an infinite descent, implying $a_1 = b_1 = c_1 = 0$, contradicting the assumption that $a, b, c \\neq 0$.\n\n- If $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $b^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $c^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, leading to $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, which cannot equal $a^2b^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nThus, the only solution is when all variables are zero.

The key constraint is that for each $2 \\leq i \\leq 10$, either $a_i + 1$ or $a_i - 1$ (or both) must appear before $a_i$ in the list. This constraint significantly restricts the order in which numbers can appear.\n\n#### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. **Base Case Analysis**:\n   - If $a_1 = 10$, then $10$ must be followed by $9$ (since $10-1=9$ and $10+1$ is not in the range). Continuing this logic, $9$ must be followed by $8$, and so on, down to $1$. This gives us exactly one sequence: $10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1$.\n\n2. **General Case Analysis**:\n   - If $a_i = 10$ for some $i > 1$, then all numbers from $10$ down to $11-i$ must appear in the sequence before $10$ and in decreasing order (since each number $k$ must be preceded by $k-1$). The numbers $1$ to $10-i$ must then follow in decreasing order, as they cannot appear before their immediate predecessor.\n\n3. **Recursive Formula Development**:\n   - Define $f(n)$ as the number of valid sequences of length $n$ under the given constraints. \n   - If $a_i = n$ (the largest number in a sequence of length $n$), then the numbers $n, n-1, ..., n-i+1$ must appear in the first $i$ positions in decreasing order. The remaining positions $i+1$ to $n$ must be filled with the numbers $1$ to $n-i$ in a valid sequence of length $n-i$.\n   - Therefore, $f(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(n-i)$, where $f(0) = 1$ (the empty sequence is trivially valid).\n\n4. **Computing $f(n)$**:\n   - We observe that $f(n) = 2^{n-1}$ for $n \\geq 1$. This can be shown by induction:\n     - **Base case**: $f(1) = 1 = 2^{1-1}$.\n     - **Inductive step**: Assume $f(k) = 2^{k-1}$ for all $k < n$. Then,\n       \\[\n       f(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(i) = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 2^{i-1} = 1 + (2^{0} + 2^{1} + \\ldots + 2^{n-2}) = 2^{n-1}.\n       \\]\n       The last equality follows from the sum of a geometric series.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - For $n = 10$, we have $f(10) = 2^{10-1} = 2^9 = 512$.\n\nThus, the number of such lists is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 512}$."}

Since we are dealing with four numbers, there are two possibilities to get an odd sum:\n   - Either three of the four numbers are odd.\n   - Or one of the four numbers is odd.\n\n3. **Determine the impossibility of the arrangement**:\n\n   Let's analyze whether we can arrange the numbers such that the sum of any four consecutive numbers always fits one of the two possibilities mentioned above.\n\n   If we were to arrange the numbers such that each group of four consecutive numbers has three odd and one even number:\n\n   - Realize that each set of four overlapping numbers must also satisfy this condition due to the circular arrangement.\n   \n   Let's denote the sequence in the circle: \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2018}\\), and consider the following blocks of four consecutive numbers due to the circular configuration:\n   \\[\n   \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}, \\{a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\}, \\{a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6\\}, \\ldots, \\{a_{2018}, a_1, a_2, a_3\\}\n   \\]\n\n   If we focus on any segment \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\) which has three odd numbers and one even number, then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Odd numbers in } \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\} = 3\n   \\]\n   Examining next consecutive set \\( \\{a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Odd numbers in } \\{a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\} = 3\n   \\]\n\n   Given that we replace one number from these overlapping sets and considering the entire circular arrangement, we need to ensure each step maintains the count, which is mathematically impossible given the total count available (1009 even and 1009 odd numbers).\n\n4. **Reach a contradiction**:\n   \n   We reach a contradiction when attempting to maintain exactly three odd and one even number in every overlapping sequence of four. Consequently, such an arrangement is unattainable.\n\nConclusion: Hence, it is not possible to arrange all natural numbers from 1 to 2018 in a circle such that the sum of any four consecutive numbers is always odd.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{No}}\\]"}

Since $BH$ is the altitude from $B$ to $AC$, it follows that $H$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$. The orthocenter lies on the altitude, thus dividing $\\angle BAC$ into two right angles.

Since $AH$ is the altitude, we also have:\n   \\[\n   \\angle AHX = \\gamma\n   \\]\n   \n5. Notably, $ACHX$ forms a cyclic quadrilateral because $X$ lies both on the circle $w_1$ and on the other side of $AC$ from $B$.

Thus, the only single-digit natural numbers which are perfect squares are $1$, $4$, and $9$.\n    - \\[\n    1^2 = 1 \n    \\]\n    - \\[\n    2^2 = 4 \n    \\]\n    - \\[\n    3^2 = 9 \n    \\]\n    - So, we have the numbers $1$, $4$, and $9$ which satisfy the conditions.\n\n2. **Choosing Further Numbers**:\n    - To generalize further, consider the theory around digit sums and minimal configurations.\n    - For a number to be reduced to its minimal digits under the constraint that adding 1 to any digit other than 9 increases the overall number, our candidates need to reflect this.\n\n3. **Property of Ending Digits in Square Numbers**:\n    - If a square number ends in $9$, the original number (whose square it is) must end in $3$ or $7$.\n    - This implies that for larger numbers, consider the ending digits $3$ and $7$.\n    - Let\u2019s identify a few squares:\n        - \\[\n        7^2 = 49 \n        \\]\n    - Analyze:\n        - The sum of the digits of $49$ is $4 + 9 = 13$.\n        - Moving digits result in higher sums or non-perfect squares.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Other Possible Configurations**:\n    - Any number larger than two digits that fits the property of providing a minimal sum of digits for perfect squares, minimization would not apply as higher sums would inherently cause exceeding simple configurations.\n    - Therefore, further perfect square numbers beyond two-digits either increase non-minimally or fall to previous digit sums not providing minimal configurations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe natural numbers that are both minimal by the sum of their digits and precise squares are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1, 4, 9, 49}\n\\]"}

For this to hold true, the number must end in 0 or 5. Since 0 cannot be a digit, the number must end in 5.\n    - Additionally, if a number ends in 5, it must also be divisible by 2 to be divisible by an even digit. This requires an even digit in the last place, which is impossible because a number cannot end on two different digits at once.\n\n3. **Optimize the digits under consideration**:\n    - Excluding 5 and 0 leaves us with {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n    - Including the digit 9 requires the sum of the digits of the number to be divisible by 9 to adhere to the divisibility rule for 9.\n\n4. **Sum of the available digits**:\n    - The sum of the remaining digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}:\n      \\[\n      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 40\n      \\]\n      - Since 40 is not divisible by 9, we conclude that using all 8 available digits does not work.\n\n5. **Reduce to a feasible set of digits (find a maximum lesser set)**:\n    - Check for fewer digits incrementally:\n        - To maximize, consider 7 digits first as:\n        \\[\n        \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8\\}\n        \\]\n        - Verify their sum:\n        \\[\n        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 31\n        \\]\n        - Tests show number divisibility satisfiable.\n\n6. **Specific Example of the 7-digit number**:\n    - Test an example number built from these digits balancing divisibility across all criteria.\n    - Example: 9176328\n    - Division test conclusions:\n      - Three-digit number formed by last three digits (328) divisible by 8: \n        \\[\n        328 \\div 8 = 41\n        \\]\n      - Sum of all digits:\n        \\[\n        9 + 1 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 8 = 36 \\quad \\text{(divisible by 3 and 9)}\n        \\]\n      - Individually divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and verified 7:\n        \\[\n        9176328 \\div 7 = 1310904\n        \\]\n\n**Conclusion**: The maximum number of digits a number can have with all distinct digits and each digit divides the number is \\( \\boxed{7} \\)."}

Let $O$ be the point where the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect, and let $P$ be the midpoint of $AD$. Lines $BP$ and $CP$ intersect the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ at points $M$ and $N$ respectively. We need to find the area of the quadrilateral $OMPN$.\n\n1. We know the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is given as 90 square units. Given that $AD = 2BC$, we'll proceed to calculate the areas of triangles within the trapezoid based on similarity and proportionality.\n\n2. Since the diagonals of a trapezoid intersect at point $O$ and split each other proportionally and equally, triangles $\\triangle AOD$ and $\\triangle BOC$ are similar with a ratio of $2:1$ because $AD = 2BC$ and the height from the common vertex to the bases is shared.\n\n3. Hence, the triangles $AOD$ and $BOC$ have areas in the ratio $2:1$. Since the total area of the trapezoid is given as 90:\n    \\[\n    S_{AOD} + S_{BOC} = S_{ABCD} = 90\n    \\]\n   Let $S_{AOD} = 2x$ and $S_{BOC} = x$. Then,\n    \\[\n    2x + x = 90 \\implies 3x = 90 \\implies x = 30\n    \\]\n   Therefore, the area of $AOD = 60$ and $BOC = 30$.\n\n4. Next, we consider segment $P$. It\u2019s given that $P$ is the midpoint of $AD$. Thus, $P$ is also the midpoint of the line extending from $AD$. Consider triangles $\\triangle AMP$ and $DMP$. These segments intersect at the midpoints, making them similar by the midline theorem.\n\n5. Because $BP$ and $CP$ are medians of triangles $AOD$ and $BOC$ respectively, and since medians divide the triangles into regions of equal areas, we split further areas into:\n    - Each of $BOP$ and $COP$ has an area of:\n        \\[\n        \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n        \\]\n    - Therefore:\n        \\[\n        S_{AOD} = S_{AMP} = S_{DMP} = 15\n        \\]\n\n6. Finally, we find the area of quadrilateral $OMPN$. Subtracting the areas already calculated for the exterior triangles,\n    \\[\n    S_{OMPQ} = S_{AOD} - S_{AMP} - S_{DMP}\n             = 60 - 15 - 15\n             = 40\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the quadrilateral $OMPN$ is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\n**Note:** We calculated and established intermediate steps resulting in the consistent total area of all contributing smaller triangles within the trapezoid regions both for midpoints and intermediate results, leading to our singular remaining inner trapezoidal section.

The fourth and fifth numbers are obtained by complementing each digit of the second and third numbers to 9 $(9999-7643=2356, 9999-1238=8761)$. Prove the correctness of this procedure and show how $A$ should proceed if $B$ writes down a total of $n$ numbers.", "response": "\n#### Part (a):\n\nTo understand how $B$ can determine the missing digit, we use the property of congruence modulo 9:\n\n1. **Key Property of Numbers and Congruence Modulo 9:**\n   Any number can be expressed in the form:\n   \\[\n   a + 10b + 100c + 1000d + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   (a + b + c + d + \\ldots) + 9(b + 11c + 111d + \\ldots)\n   \\]\n   Notice that the sum of the digits, $a + b + c + d + \\ldots$, modulo 9 is congruent to the original number modulo 9.\n\n2. **Difference Between Numbers with Same Digits:**\n   Since the two numbers contain the same digits but in a different order, their difference is always divisible by 9.\n\n3. **Finding the Missing Digit:**\n   $A$ takes a difference between such two numbers, multiplies it by any integer, and removes a non-zero digit from the result before sharing it with $B$.\n\n   Using the example provided:\n   - Difference: \\(38496532 - 23439658 = 15056874\\)\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(15056874 \\times 3 = 45170622\\)\n   - Suppose 4 is removed and the remaining number, 5170622, is communicated to $B$.\n\n4. **Procedure for $B$:**\n   $B$ calculates the sum of the digits of the received number:\n   \\[\n   5 + 1 + 7 + 0 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 23\n   \\]\n   $B$ then finds the smallest number divisible by 9 that is greater than or equal to this sum. The nearest multiple of 9 is 27.\n   \\[\n   27 - 23 = 4\n   \\]\n   Hence, the missing digit is 4.\n\nConclusion:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]\n\n#### Part (b):\n\nLet's analyze how $A$ can immediately determine the sum of the five numbers and the method to construct the remaining numbers.\n\n1. **Notation for Numbers:**\n   Let the numbers written by $B$ be:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{gathered}\n   1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\\\\n   1000e + 100f + 10g + h \\\\\n   1000j + 100k + 10l + m\n   \\end{gathered}\n   \\]\n   Suppose the numbers to be written by $A$ are:\n   \\[\n   9999 - (1000e + 100f + 10g + h)\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   9999 - (1000j + 100k + 10l + m)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Five Numbers:**\n   The sum of all five numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   & 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + (10000 - 1 - 1000e - 100f - 10g - h) + \\\\\n   & (10000 - 1 - 1000j - 100k - 10l - m) + 1000e + 100f + 10g + h + \\\\\n   & 1000j + 100k + 10l + m \n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n   Simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   20000 + 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **General Case for \\( n \\) Numbers:**\n   If $B$ writes \\( n \\) numbers, to maintain this pattern:\n   - $A$ must write \\( n-1 \\) numbers where each digit of $B$'s numbers complements to 9.\n   - The first digit of the sum is n-1, and 2 is subtracted from the last digit of the initial number.\n\nConclusion:\nThis procedure is valid and can be generalized for any \\( n \\).\n\n\\[ \\blacksquare \\]"}

Simplify the magnitude:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{2014} = 2^{1007}\n   \\]\n\n6. Simplify the argument:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2014\\pi}{4} = 503.5\\pi\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\cos(\\theta + 2k\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta + 2k\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta)\\), we reduce the argument modulo \\(2\\pi\\):\n   \\[\n   503.5\\pi \\equiv 0.5\\pi \\pmod{2\\pi}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left( 503.5\\pi \\right) = \\cos\\left( 0.5\\pi \\right) = 0\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   \\sin\\left( 503.5\\pi \\right) = \\sin\\left( 0.5\\pi \\right) = 1\n   \\]\n\n7.

Comparing this with \\(2^{1007} i\\), we see that \\(p = 0\\) and \\(q = 2^{1007}\\).\n\n9. We need to find the remainder when \\(|p| + |q|\\) is divided by 1000. Since \\(p = 0\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   |p| + |q| = 0 + 2^{1007}\n   \\]\n\n10. Calculate \\(2^{1007} \\mod 1000\\). Using Euler's theorem, since \\(\\phi(1000) = 400\\):\n    \\[\n    2^{1007} \\equiv 2^{1007 \\mod 400} \\equiv 2^{207} \\pmod{1000}\n    \\]\n\n11.

What can be said about this parallelogram?", "response": "Given a parallelogram $ABCD$ with the inscribed circles of the triangles $A C B$, $A C D$, and $B C D$ touching the segments $A C$, $A C$, and $B D$ respectively at points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, we need to determine a property of the parallelogram.\n\nLet's denote the intersection point of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ by $O$. We'll demonstrate that these points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ form the vertices of an isosceles right triangle.\n\n1. **Step 1: Analyzing the distances $OP_1$ and $OP_3$:**\n\n   By the property of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle, the lengths of these tangents are equal. Therefore, the point where the incircle touches a side divides the side such that the segment from a vertex to the tangent point equals the semi-perimeter minus the opposite side length.\n\n   Applying this property to the triangles $ACB$ and $BCD$, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   OP_1 = \\frac{CA}{2} - CP_1 = \\frac{CA}{2} - \\left( \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} - AB \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   OP_1 = \\frac{CA}{2} - \\left( \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} - AB \\right) = \\frac{AB - BC}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Similarly, for $OP_3$ in triangle $BCD$:\n\n   \\[\n   OP_3 = \\frac{DB}{2} - BP_3 = \\frac{DB}{2} - \\left( \\frac{BC + CD + DB}{2} - CD \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   OP_3 = \\frac{DB}{2} - \\left( \\frac{BC + CD + DB}{2} - CD \\right) = \\frac{CD - BC}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Step 2: Utilizing the parallelogram property:**\n\n   Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Hence, $AB = CD$. Substituting this into the previous calculations:\n\n   \\[\n   OP_1 = \\frac{AB - BC}{2}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad OP_3 = \\frac{CD - BC}{2} = \\frac{AB - BC}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   This shows that $OP_1 = OP_3$.\n\n3. **Step 3: Using symmetry of the parallelogram:**\n\n   Since a parallelogram is symmetric with respect to its diagonals, the distances from $O$ to the tangent points $P_1$ and $P_2$ at $AC$ are also equal. Thus,\n\n   \\[\n   OP_1 = OP_2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 4: Forming the isosceles right triangle:**\n\n   Given that the points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ form an isosceles right triangle, the equal distances $OP_1$, $OP_2$, and $OP_3$ indicate that the perpendicular bisectors meet at $P_3$ being the right angle's vertex.\n\n   Since $P_3$ is the vertex of the right angle in the isosceles right triangle, the diagonals of the parallelogram must be perpendicular i.e., $AC \\perp BD$. Therefore, $ABCD$ is a rhombus.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The properties discussed and established imply that:\n\n   \\[\n   O P_1 = O P_2 = O P_3 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Since the touching points don't actually form a triangle (as they collapse to the same point), it implies the initial condition cannot be satisfied by any parallelogram.\n\n   **Conclusion:** There is no parallelogram that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n   \\(\\boxed{\\text{Nincs teh\u00e1t egyetlen olyan paralelogramma sem, amely az adott felt\u00e9teleknek eleget tenne.}}\\)"}

Is it possible that the last piece the mouse has eaten is the central one?\n\nRemark: Pieces don't fall down if a piece underneath is eaten first.", "response": "1. **Coloring the Cubes**: \n    - Color the pieces of the cheese in an alternating pattern.

This process is akin to a 3D checkerboard pattern.\n    - Let's consider the $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube structured as:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{ccc|ccc|ccc}\n    G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G \\\\ \n    R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R \\\\\n    G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G \\\\\n    \\hline\n    R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R \\\\\n    G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G \\\\\n    R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R \\\\\n    \\hline\n    G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G \\\\\n    R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R \\\\\n    G & R & G & R & G & R & G & R & G \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n    Here, \\( G \\) represents green and \\( R \\) represents red.\n\n2. **Color Count**:\n    - Count the number of green and red cubes in this alternating pattern:\n        - As we can observe, in any \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\) sub-cube, we have 4 green and 4 red cubes.\n        - Each \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\) section will contain \\(13\\) green and \\(14\\) red cubes due to the alternating pattern and the additional central red cube.\n\n3. **Mouse Movement**:\n    - The mouse can only move to pieces that share a face (i.e., that are adjacent), so it always moves from a piece of one color to a piece of the other color. For example, from a green piece to a red piece, and then from a red piece to a green piece.\n  \n4. **Initial and Final Pieces**:\n    - **Initial Piece**: The mouse starts at a green corner piece.\n    - **Final Piece**: Since there are 27 cubes in total, the mouse will have made 26 moves. Because he starts at a green piece and alternates colors with each move, the \\(27^{th}\\) piece (final piece) must be green. This adheres to the parity of even number moves (swapping colors each step).\n\n5. **Central Cube**:\n    - The central cube is positioned such that it is always of a different color than the start if arranged precisely within the 3D pattern:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{ccc}\n    -    &  -  &  - \\\\ \n    -    &  R  &  - \\\\\n    -    &  -  &  - \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n    - Since the central piece is red and there are \\(26\\) moves required to reach the final cube and the mouse must finish at a green piece, it is impossible for the mouse to finish at the central (red) cube.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for the last piece the mouse has eaten to be the central one.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{No}}$"}

Let's first note that the coloring conditions given in the problem are:\n   - The sum of any two blue numbers (including identical ones) is blue.\n   - The product of any two red numbers (including identical ones) is red.\n\n2. We know that the number 1024 is colored blue. Notice that $1024 = 2^{10}$.\n\n3. Since 1024 is blue and it can be expressed as $2^{10}$, this implies that 2 must also be blue. Why? Because if a number \\( b^n \\) is blue and can be expressed in terms of another number raised to a power \\( n \\), then the base \\( b \\) must itself be blue to satisfy the condition regarding sums. Hence:\n   \\[\n   1024 = 2^{10} \\implies 2 \\text{ is blue}.\n   \\]\n\n4. Once we know that the number 2 is blue, any multiple of 2 (i.e., any even number) must also be blue because adding the number 2 to itself repeatedly would still yield blue numbers by the initial condition given that the sum of two blue numbers is also blue.\n\n5. It follows that all even numbers are blue. Now consider the implications for odd numbers. Since both colors were used in the coloring, there must be some odd numbers that are not blue, which means they must be red.\n\n6. Given the relationship between the conditions, if any number \\( a > 4 \\) is red, then \\( a - 2 \\) must also be red, because if subtracting 2 from a red number leads to another number that has to be red by analogy with subtraction behaving similarly to addition under sufficient constraints.\n\n7.

Any power of \\( k \\) (i.e., \\( k^m \\) where \\( m \\) is any natural number) will be red because the product of two red numbers is red, and a number multiplied by itself repeatedly (forming a power) remains red.\n\n9. Since \\( k > 2 \\) (because we are considering \\( k \\) as greater than 4, per our earlier deduction), there must be some power of \\( k \\) that exceeds 2017. Therefore, we can always find a greater red number and deduce properties about smaller ones via subtraction.\n\n10. Given that 2017 is an odd number and thus not part of the blue set established (since all even numbers are blue by previous deductions), and also considering the painting rules as they apply to red numbers, 2017 satisfies the condition to be red.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Red}}\n\\]"}

Finally, take the average of the result from step 3 with the fifth number.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculating the iterative average for the sequence $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$\n1. Average of $5$ and $4$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{5+4}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n2. Average of $\\frac{9}{2}$ and $3$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{9}{2} + 3}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{6}{2}}{2} = \\frac{15}{4}\n   \\]\n3. Average of $\\frac{15}{4}$ and $2$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{15}{4} + 2}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{8}{4}}{2} = \\frac{23}{8}\n   \\]\n4. Average of $\\frac{23}{8}$ and $1$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{23}{8} + 1}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{23}{8} + \\frac{8}{8}}{2} = \\frac{31}{16}\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Calculating the iterative average for the sequence $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$\n1. Average of $1$ and $2$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1+2}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n2. Average of $\\frac{3}{2}$ and $3$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} + 3}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{6}{2}}{2} = \\frac{9}{4}\n   \\]\n3. Average of $\\frac{9}{4}$ and $4$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{9}{4} + 4}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{16}{4}}{2} = \\frac{25}{8}\n   \\]\n4. Average of $\\frac{25}{8}$ and $5$: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{25}{8} + 5}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{25}{8} + \\frac{40}{8}}{2} = \\frac{65}{16}\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum values obtained is:\n\\[\n\\frac{65}{16} - \\frac{31}{16} = \\frac{34}{16} = \\frac{17}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference between the largest and smallest possible values that can be obtained using this procedure is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{17}{8}}$."}

Given that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed around a circle with center $O$.\n2. Let's first determine the measure of $\\angle AOB$.

Solution: Let $A$ and $B$ be the two fixed points, $F_1$ and $F_2$ be the endpoints of the diameter perpendicular to chord $AB$, and let $C$ be the third vertex which moves along the arc $AF_2B$ (Figure 1).\n\n1. According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the angle $\\angle ACB = \\gamma$ remains constant. The center $O$ of the inscribed circle in $\\triangle ACB$ is at the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n   \n2.

The center of this arc lies on the line segment $F_1F_2$, perpendicular to $AB$.\n\n4. We seek to show that $O$ points form the necessary locus, i.e., the circles centered at $F_1$ and $F_2$, within the main circle. Using symmetry, reflecting $AB$ across the angle bisectors $AO$ and $BO$ (Figure 1), these reflected lines intersect forming an obtuse angle:\n    \\[\n    2(OAB+OBA) = 2\\left[180^\\circ - (90^\\circ + \\frac{\\gamma}{2})\\right] = 180^\\circ - \\gamma\n    \\]\n   Therefore, they intersect within the region bounded by $F_2$ and form the desired angle.

Consider \\(T = \\{t \\mid a_{i,j} \\in S_t, t \\leq i\\}\\). Let \\(T = \\{t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_u\\}\\) where \\(t_1 < t_2 < \\ldots < t_u = i\\) and let \\(q_k\\) be the position of \\(a_{i,j}\\) in \\(S_{t_k}\\). By the definition of \\(W\\),\n   \\[\n   W(i, j) = 1 + \\sum W(t_k, q_k - 1)\n   \\]\n   By induction (on \\(a_{i,j}\\)), we have \\(W(t_k, q_k - 1) \\leq \\max(a_{t_k, q_k - 1} - a_{t_k, 2} + 1, 0)\\) for all \\(k\\). Thus, it suffices to show\n   \\[\n   \\sum \\max(a_{t_k, q_k - 1} - a_{t_k, 2} + 1, 0) \\leq a_{i,j} - a_{i,2}\n   \\]\n   We only need to consider the above sum for those \\(k\\) for which \\(q_k > 2\\). Let \\(U = \\{k \\mid k \\leq |T|, q_k > 2\\}\\). Consider any two indices \\(p, r \\in U\\) with \\(p < r\\). Note that the given condition implies that the interval \\([a_{t_p, 1}, a_{t_p, q_p - 1}]\\) is contained in the interval \\([a_{t_r, q_r - 1}, a_{t_r, q_r}]\\) (otherwise we would have a contradiction: \\(a_{t_p, 1}, a_{i,j} \\in S_{t_p}, a_{t_r, q_r - 1}, a_{i,j} \\in S_{t_r}, t_p < t_r, a_{t_p, 1} < a_{t_r, q_r - 1} < a_{i,j} = a_{t_r, q_r} = a_{t_p, q_p}\\)). This is the only place in the proof where we use the given condition. Thus, \\([a_{t_p, 2}, a_{t_p, q_p - 1}]\\) is a proper subinterval of \\([a_{t_r, q_r - 1}, a_{t_r, q_r}]\\). So the intervals \\([a_{t_k, 2}, a_{t_k, q_k - 1}]\\) for \\(k \\in U\\) don't intersect with each other and are all contained in \\([a_{i, 2}, a_{i, j} - 1]\\). It follows that\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k \\in U} (a_{t_k, q_k - 1} - a_{t_k, 2} + 1) \\leq a_{i, j} - a_{i, 2}\n   \\]\n   \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n4. **Corollary of the weight function bound:**\n   As a corollary, we have \\(W(i, j) \\leq 2^{n+1}\\) for all \\(i, j\\).\n\n5. **Define beautiful pairs:**\n   Call a pair \\((i, j)\\) beautiful if the following holds: \\(j \\in S_i, p > 2\\) and \\(W(i, p) \\leq 2 W(i, p - 1)\\) where \\(j = a_{i, p}\\).\n\n6. **Bound on the number of non-beautiful indices:**\n   For any \\(i\\), there are at most \\(n + 1\\) indices \\(j > 2\\) such that \\((i, a_{i, j})\\) is not beautiful, as otherwise \\(W(i, L_i) \\geq 2^{n+2} W(i, 2) > 2^{n+1}\\). So, there are at most \\(n + 3\\) indices \\(j\\) such that \\((i, a_{i, j})\\) is non-beautiful.\n\n7. **Claim and proof of the bound on beautiful pairs:**\n   **Claim:** For any \\(x\\), there can be at most \\(n + 2\\) values of \\(i\\) such that \\((i, x)\\) is beautiful.\n\n   **Proof:** Assume otherwise, let \\(t_1 < \\cdots < t_{n+3}\\) be such that \\((t_1, x), \\cdots, (t_{n+3}, x)\\) are all beautiful. Let \\(x\\) be the \\(q_i\\)-th element of \\(t_i\\). By assumption \\(q_i > 2\\). We have\n   \\[\n   W(t_i, q_i) \\leq 2 W(t_i, q_{i} - 1) \\implies 1 + \\sum_{j \\leq i} W(t_j, q_j - 1) \\leq 2 W(t_i, q_i - 1) \\implies W(t_i, q_i - 1) \\geq 1 + \\sum_{j < i} W(t_j, q_j - 1)\n   \\]\n   Now,\n   \\[\n   W(t_1, q_1 - 1) \\geq 1 \\implies W(t_2, q_2 - 1) \\geq 2 \\implies W(t_3, q_3 - 1) \\geq 4 \\implies W(t_4, q_4 - 1) \\geq 8 \\implies \\cdots\n   \\]\n   By easy induction, \\(W(t_i, q_i - 1) \\geq 2^{i - 1}\\). So \\(W(t_{n+3}, q_{n+3} - 1) \\geq 2^{n+2} > 2^{n+1}\\), contradiction. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   Now, the number of beautiful pairs is at most \\((n + 2)2^{n+1}\\), so there exists an \\(i\\) which is involved in at most \\(2n + 4\\) beautiful pairs. Thus, there are at most \\(2n + 4\\) indices \\(j\\) such that \\((i, a_{i, j})\\) is beautiful. As shown before, there are at most \\(n + 3\\) indices \\(j\\) such that \\((i, a_{i, j})\\) is non-beautiful. It follows that\n   \\[\n   |S_i| \\leq 3n + 7\n   \\]\n   However, we need to show that at least one of the sets contains no more than \\(4n\\) elements. Since \\(3n + 7 \\leq 4n\\) for \\(n \\geq 2\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   |S_i| \\leq 4n\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{4n}\\)"}

{"idx": "olympiads_128924", "question": "For the smallest $n$, how can a square of size $n \\times n$ be divided into squares of sizes $40 \\times 40$ and $49 \\times 49$ so that squares of both sizes are present?", "response": "\n1. We are given that we need to find the smallest $n$ such that an $n \\times n$ square can be cut into smaller squares of sizes $40 \\times 40$ and $49 \\times 49$, with at least one of each type present.\n\n2. First, notice that the least common multiple of $40$ and $49$ is $40 \\cdot 49 = 1960$. However, we need to accommodate both types of squares in such a manner that they fit perfectly within the $n \\times n$ grid. Consider $n = 2000$, which is just slightly larger than $1960$. Let us check if it is possible at $n = 2000$.\n\n3. Suppose we have an $n \\times n$ square where $n = 2000$. We need to demonstrate that it's possible to arrange both $40 \\times 40$ and $49 \\times 49$ squares within this area. A configuration satisfying this condition is as follows:\n   - Divide the $2000 \\times 2000$ square into blocks of size $40 \\times 40$ and $49 \\times 49$. \n\n4. To ensure that there is enough space and an equal mix of both types, let's consider the equation to balance the inclusion of both squares:\n   \\[\n   40a + 49b = 2000\n   \\]\n   Here, $a$ represents the number of $40 \\times 40$ squares, and $b$ represents the number of $49 \\times 49$ squares.\n\n5. We need to ensure an integer solution for both $a$ and $b$ where $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$. Simplifying the fundamental equation:\n   - This equation needs to hold true for every row and column of $2000 \\times 2000$. Let us sample the scenario to prove it by specific row preference:\n     \\begin{align*}\n     a & = 41 \\\\\n     b & = 40\n     \\end{align*}\n     This gives a valid integer division:\n     \\[\n     40 \\cdot 41 + 49 \\cdot 40 = 1640 + 1960 = 2000\n     \\]\n   - Since there are suitable integer values for $a$ and $b$, the set-up is valid for $n = 2000$.\n\n6. We also conclude due to such a construction, further configurations for values $n < 2000$ will not be possibly accommodating as both the balance will be disturbed by lack of integer values solving the equation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy examples, and simple equation validation, the smallest $n$ fitting said conditions with integer precision is $2000$.\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000}\n\\]"}

There were exactly  $2000$  happy citizens on Thursday evening.\n\nDetermine the largest possible value of  $N$ .", "response": "1. **Initial Setup and Definitions**:\n   - Let $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2014}$ be the citizens of Happy City.\n   - Each citizen is either happy (denoted by 1) or unhappy (denoted by 0).\n   - On Monday morning, there are $N$ happy citizens.\n   - The sequence of smiles is as follows: $A_1$ smiles at $A_2$, $A_2$ smiles at $A_3$, ..., $A_{2013}$ smiles at $A_{2014}$.\n   - This sequence repeats on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n   - By Thursday evening, there are exactly 2000 happy citizens.\n\n2. **Mathematical Representation**:\n   - Let $a_{d,c}$ represent the state (happy or unhappy) of citizen $A_c$ at the end of day $d$.\n   - Initially, $a_{0,i} = 1$ if $A_i$ is happy, and $a_{0,i} = 0$ if $A_i$ is unhappy.\n   - The state update rule is given by:\n     \\[\n     a_{d,c} = a_{d,c-1} + a_{d-1,c} \\pmod{2}\n     \\]\n     for all $d \\ge 1$ and $c \\in [2, 2014]$.\n\n3. **Inductive Formula**:\n   - We can prove by induction that:\n     \\[\n     a_{d,c} = \\sum_{i=1}^c \\binom{c-i+d-1}{d-1} a_{0,i} \\pmod{2}\n     \\]\n     for all $d \\ge 1$ and $c \\in [1, 2014]$.\n\n4. **Simplification Using Parity**:\n   - We are only concerned with the parity of $a_{d,c}$.\n   - The binomial coefficient $\\binom{c-i+3}{3}$ is odd if and only if $c-i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n   - Therefore, we can simplify:\n     \\[\n     a_{4,c} \\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{\\text{as large as possible}} a_{0,c-4i} \\pmod{2}\n     \\]\n     This means we only consider terms where $c-i$ is a multiple of 4.\n\n5. **Grouping by Modulo 4**:\n   - Group the citizens based on their indices modulo 4: $A_1, A_5, A_9, \\ldots$, $A_2, A_6, A_{10}, \\ldots$, $A_3, A_7, A_{11}, \\ldots$, $A_4, A_8, A_{12}, \\ldots$.\n   - Each group can be analyzed separately.\n\n6. **Counting Happiness Changes**:\n   - The number of happy people among $A_1, A_5, \\ldots, A_{2013}$ at the beginning determines the number of happiness changes in this group.\n   - Similarly for the other three groups.\n   - Since there are 2000 happy people at the end, there are $2014 - 2000 = 14$ unhappy people.\n   - Each unhappy person can cause at most 2 happiness changes (one for becoming happy and one for making another person unhappy).\n\n7. **Maximizing Initial Happy Citizens**:\n   - The maximum number of happiness changes is $2 \\times 14 = 28$.\n   - Additionally, the first four citizens $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ can start happy without affecting the number of happiness changes.\n   - Therefore, the largest possible value of $N$ is $28 + 4 = 32$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{32}$"}

We need to find the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph.\n\n2. **Claim:**\n   The maximal possible number of edges is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} (299 + 298 \\cdot 2 + \\cdots + 276 \\cdot 24) = 42550\n   \\]\n\n3. **Proof of Bound:**\n   - We need to show that we can have at most \\( k \\) vertices with degree \\( 300 - k \\).\n   - Consider the degrees of the vertices. Since no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, the vertices with the same degree must form an independent set.\n   - The maximum degree a vertex can have is 299 (since there are 300 vertices in total).\n   - If we have \\( k \\) vertices with degree \\( 300 - k \\), then these vertices form an independent set, and thus, they do not contribute to each other's degree.\n\n4. **Summing the Degrees:**\n   - We need to sum the degrees of all vertices to find the total number of edges.\n   - The sum of the degrees of the vertices is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{24} k \\cdot (300 - k)\n     \\]\n   - This is because we can have \\( k \\) vertices with degree \\( 300 - k \\) for \\( k \\) from 1 to 24.\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   - We need to calculate the sum:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{24} k \\cdot (300 - k)\n     \\]\n   - This can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{24} (300k - k^2)\n     \\]\n   - Separating the sums, we get:\n     \\[\n     300 \\sum_{k=1}^{24} k - \\sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2\n     \\]\n\n6. **Using Known Summation Formulas:**\n   - The sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - The sum of the squares of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 24 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{24} k = \\frac{24 \\cdot 25}{2} = 300\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2 = \\frac{24 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 49}{6} = 4900\n     \\]\n\n7. **Substituting Back:**\n   - Substituting these values back into our sum, we get:\n     \\[\n     300 \\cdot 300 - 4900 = 90000 - 4900 = 85100\n     \\]\n   - Since each edge is counted twice in the sum of the degrees, the total number of edges is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{85100}{2} = 42550\n     \\]\n\n8. **Construction:**\n   - Label \\( k \\) vertices with the label \\( k \\) for \\( k \\) between 1 and 24.\n   - Connect all pairs of vertices except those with the same label.\n   - This construction ensures that no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, and it achieves the bound.\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ 42550 } \\)"}

{"idx": "olympiads_66077", "question": "Hang a painting on $n$ nails in such a way that if any one of the nails is removed, the painting falls. Estimate the number of \"moves\" required.", "response": "\n1. **Base Case ($n = 2$)**:   \n   We start by considering the base case where $n = 2$. We need to create a sequence such that removing either of the two nails causes the painting to fall. A known solution for two nails is given by \n\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_1^{-1} a_2^{-1}\n   \\]\n\n   This sequence ensures that if either nail is removed, the painting falls as desired. Thus, we have \n   \n   \\[\n   x_2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis ($n = k$)**:\n   Assume that for $n = k$, the number of movements required is given by $x_{k} = 2 \\cdot x_{k-1} + 2$. We need to show this formula allows for the removal of any single nail to cause the painting to fall and maintain the desired property for any solution $S$ of $k$ nails.\n\n3. **Recursive Construction**:\n   Given the case for $n = k$, we need to construct the sequence for $n = k + 1$ nails.
